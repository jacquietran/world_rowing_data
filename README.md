# World Rowing race results

Liberating race data from PDFs supplied by World Rowing.

## Objectives

1. Create functions to efficiently extract data tables from the PDFs supplied by World Rowing and tidy the extracted data.
2. Create a data package to store race data from World Rowing & Olympic rowing regattas in a rectangular and tidy format.

## Constraints

To begin with, I am focusing only on:

- Olympic Games
- World Rowing Championships
- World Rowing Cups I, II, III

In time, this work could extend to other events.
